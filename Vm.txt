3 part: Sudo Installation
1- After you log in, write this su - 
2- when you in root write this apt install sudo
3- then reboot and log in again

4 part: Adding users
1- write su -
2- while in root write usermod -aG sudo yourusername
	 -a is a shortcut for --append: It means append the group to the list of groups the user belongs to!
	 -G is a shortcut for --groups: It tells usermod that the next argument is a group. 
	  Note that you need to use a capital -G here because we don’t want to modify the user’s primary group but the list of supplemental groups the user belongs to.
3- check if user is in sudo group getent group sudo
4- Add group user42 -> groupadd user42
5- Add user to group user42 -> usermod -aG user42 yourusername

5 part: Installing ssh
1- write exit so you leave su -
2- sudo apt install openssh-server
3- this is to check if ssh service is running sudo systemctl status ssh
4- go to /etc/ssh, sudo nano sshd_config and edit #Port22 to Port4242 and 
	#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password to PermitRootLogin no, save and exit
5- sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config -> etid #Port22 to Port4242
6- sudo service ssh status
8- Install UFW(Unsophisticade firewall) -> sudo apt install ufw
9- sudo ufw enable
10- sudo ufw allow 4242
11- sudo service ssh restart
12- sudo ufw status(it can only be port 4242 their)

6 part: Configuring sudo
1- cd /etc/sudoers.d/
2- sudo visudo
	Defaults      passwd_tries=3                            
	Defaults      badpass_message="Incorrect password"        <- you can set your
	Defaults      logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log"                         own message here
	Defaults      log_input, log_output                 
	Defaults      requiretty                                
	Defaults      secure_path="that/long/paths/from/subject"

7 part: Strong Password policy
1- sudo apt install libpam-pwquality
2- sudo nano /etc/login.defs
	PASS_MAX_DAYS    99999 -> PASS_MAX_DAYS    30 
	PASS_MIN_DAYS    0     -> PASS_MIN_DAYS    2
3- sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password
	Find password requisite pam_quality.so retry=3 and write this 
	ucredit=-1(this means you need at least on upper-case letter in pw)
	lcredit=-1(this means you need at least one lower-case in pw)
	dcredit=-1(this means you need at least one digit i pw)
	minlen=10(minimum length of pw)
	maxrepeat=3(this means you have a max of consecutive identical chars in pw)
	usercheck=0(this means if password contains the username)
	difok=7(this means you are going to set a minimum number of chars thas has to do be different from the old pw)
	enforce_for_root(this means you need to reboot after changing pw)
5- reboot VM - sudo reboot
6- change password for user -> passwd
7- change password for root -> sudo password

8 part: Conecting to VM
1- Go to oracle
2- Choose your VM
3- Go to settings
4- Choose Network
5- Select Adapter 1
6- In Attached to: change to Bridged Adapter
7- sudo reboot
8- hostname -I (so you can see the ip off your VM)
9- Go to your terminal on your physical computer
	write this (anywhere) ssh -p 4242 yourusernameonthevm@theipofyourvm and you should see
	a message asking for fingerprint just write "yes" and then you are connected
9 part: Scrip
1- Install net-tools - sudo apt install net-tools
2- this is where the script will be sudo nano /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh 
3- Every script starts with #!/bin/bash
	wall is a command-line that displays a message on the terminal of all loged-in users.
	the message can be in terminal on the contents of a file
	The command uname -a is used to get the architecture, uname us used to print certain system information including kernel name, and the -a or all prints all information
	The command grep is a tool used to search for a string of characters in a specified file
4- arch=$(uname -a)
	phyproc=$(grep "physical id" /proc/cpuinfo | sort | uniq | wc -l)
	virtproc=$(grep "processor" /proc/cpuinfo  | wc -l)
	ram_free=$(free -m | grep Mem | awk '{print $4}') (to see free RAM use free -m th -m flag makes the output in MB)
	We only want the Mem row so we use grep Mem, what we want is on the 4th column, so to represent that we use $4 and to show the value we use awk '{print $4}'
	What akw is?
	Awk is a scripting language used for manipulating data and generating reports. The awk command programming language requires no compiling and allows the user to use variables, numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators. 
	Awk is a utility that enables a programmer to write tiny but effective programs in the form of statements that define text patterns that are to be searched for in each line of a document and the action that is to be taken when a match is found within a line. Awk is mostly used for pattern scanning and processing. It searches one or more files to see if they contain lines that matches with the specified patterns and then perform the associated actions. 

	Awk is abbreviated from the names of the developers – Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan. 
	total_ram=$(free -m | grep Mem | awk '{print $2}')
	ram_usage_percent=$(free -m | grep Mem | | awk '{printf("%.2f", $3/$2*100}')
